Setting Up the New NAS
----------
Recently our home NAS has been upgraded. One of the most important upgrades was the addition of more hard drive space. The HDD capacity was upgraded from 1.34TB to 3.58TB. Right now I'm still transferring the files from the old NAS, so it's likely that the final capacity will be 4.92TB. Here I'll be listing off my specifications and software setups, possibly giving you some ideas for if you're interested in setting up your own NAS.

Hardware
----------
CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3113 @ 3.00GHz
Memory: 4041768 kB
HDD1: 74.5G
HDD2: 931.5G
HDD3: 931.5G
HDD4: 931.5G
HDD5: 931.5G

Software
----------
Operating System: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS
Software: LVM, samba, plexmediaserver

Samba Config
----------
[jerry]
   comment = apartment nas
   path = /srv/storage
   browsable = yes
   writable = yes
   guest ok = yes
   guest only = yes
   read only = no
   create mask = 0755

Setup
----------
Basically, the choice for Ubuntu was for the simplicity and support. LVM was used to merge the 4 1TB drives together and will likely be used later for simple storage upgrades. Samba was chosen over alternatives such as Freenas due to our limited system specs, particularly the lack of enough RAM to utilize ZFS. Finally, plexmediaserver was chosen as a result of its ease of use and extensive list of features. I highly recommend Plex and anyone with a good media library and desire to access their media from other locations will find it very helpful.
